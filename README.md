# ðŸ§  LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository!  
This is a collection of solutions I've written while practicing data structures, algorithms, and system design problems â€” primarily in **Python**, **C++**, and **JavaScript**.

The main goals of this project are:
- ðŸ§  Strengthen problem-solving skills  
- ðŸ§ª Learn different algorithmic paradigms and patterns  
- ðŸ“š Build a reference of well-documented solutions  
- ðŸš€ Improve coding speed and clarity for technical interviews
